Also, make sure to use something unix based or at least unix-like(GNU) because Windows is for chumps ;)

The python interpreter is usually installed as 'usr/local/bin/python3.8'
You can call it in a bash shell with 

$python3

assuming it's already installed, and that it's the correct alias for calling python3.8.

You can exit the python interpreter by passing

$exit()

There is an additional way of calling the interpreter with

$python -c command [arg] 

which executes the statements in command.

There are many more flags you can use when calling 'python' in the interpreter, you can find out more here:
https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#using-on-general

In interactive mode if you call statements that require identation, the interpreter automatically will not execute
the code until it appears that a valid statement has been passed. 

Finally, there is the interpreter and its environment
By default the python source files are treated as encode in UTF-8, where characters of most langauges in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments...

However, for the most part, beginners don't have to worry about most of the above; often we'll be using either a notebook, text editor, or IDE to write out scripts and programs in! The above should make the user aware of what is available with python...
